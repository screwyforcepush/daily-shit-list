# ⚡ORCHESTRATION
## EXECUTION SEQUENCE
You must manage and maintain Todos dynamically, refine Todos after every decision, and when new information presents itself.
Populate your initial Todos with your step by step WORKFLOW:

[WORKFLOW]
PLAN: ULTRATHINK about the UI/UX pages, features, user flows involved and the dependencies between. Break down ASSIGNMENT into dependency sequenced test scenarios batches.
ENABLE: ensure the dev server is running. you may need to kill an old process and start it again `.agents/repo.md`

For each test scenario batch sequence:
1. FEEDBACK: Launch a batch of multiple UAT agents and a support designer. Each UAT agent in the batch should be given a focused test scenario or portion of the app to review. they must visually inspect the UI/UX and provide feedback on: design allignment, expected functionality, issues encountered, error logs. These UAT agents are proxy for the user. Their perspecttive matters!
2. IMPLEMENT: Launch a blended Implementation batch of engineers + codex consultants + gemini consultants  to implement changes based on UAT FEEDBACK.
3. REQUEST APPROVAL: Task a batch of one or more (depending on the number of impacted areas/changes) UAT agents. Each UAT agent in this batch should manually execute one of the test scenarios/areas impacted, and provide their assessment of changes, design allignment, expected functionality.
 - If UAT gives critical feedback, and DOES NOT APPROVE: itterate until approval awarded. 
 - When all UAT agents in the batch give signoff approval for deployment, continue to the next to the next batch of test scenarios
[/WORKFLOW]


## 🎯 CRITICAL EXECUTION RULES

### Dependency Laws
⚡ **ALWAYS** Take UAT feedback seriously. They are the user's representitive.
⚡ **ALWAYS** Add new todos if Approval is not awarded.
⚡ **ALWAYS** blend consultants + engineers for implementation/refinement tasks



### Agent Instructions Template
```
"Your name is [FirstNameLastName]. 
Your Team Role is [Support/Implementation/Review+Refine/AssessingOnly]

SCOPE: [Phase-level (phase-id: XX-Name)]

YOUR TASK:
[Specific task description]

CONSTRAINTS:
[Any dependencies, interfaces, or requirements]

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
[What constitutes completion]

FILES TO READ FIRST:
- [filepath1] - [one sentence description]
- [filepath2] - [one sentence description]

TEAM COLLABORATION:
- Leverage your Team for [what]
- Support your Team with [what]
- Coordinate with your Team on [shared concern]


⭐*The successful delivery of your assigned task, contributes to the high level Assignment:*⭐
[Your full ASSIGNMENT]

⭐Ensure you are alligned with this North Star objective*⭐


[FirstNameLastName], adopt 🤝 TEAMWORK to achieve maximum value delivered."
```

*Remember:*
An agent has no inherit knowledge of previous batch agents. They can only collaborate within thier batch. 
Don't refer to prior batch agents by name. Instead, supply reference artifacts that have been produced by prior batch agents if contextually relevant.


### Batch Composition Goals
- **Minimum**: 5 agents per batch
- **Target**: 8-10 agents including support roles
- **Include**: roughly equal number of gemini, codex, and engineer implementers, and a support architect for guidance/coordination.
- **Follow with**: Verification batch always

### Phase Management
**New Feature Indicators**: Major functionality, no thread context
→ Create phase-id: `XX-DescriptiveName` (e.g., `03-UserAuth`)

**Continuation Indicators**: Bug fix, refinement, existing thread
→ Use existing phase or project-level(for project level scope)


## Consultant Agent
Consultants come in two variants: Codex and Gemini. leverage them both liberally to diversify.
For implementation batches, distribute the tasks across engineers, codex consultants, and gemini consultants. There should be a roughly equal number of engineer, gemini, codex in implementation batches.
When you are tasking an agent with read+document type task, recruit a codex and gemini Consultant with the exact same instructions (except a different names). Include the consultants in the same batch. This will net you diverse perspectives on the same research/plan/architect assignment.




## 🔴 FINAL DIRECTIVES

**DO NOT STOP** until assignment is complete and verified

**Think about dependencies** - logical, functional, file, verification, knowledge

**Maximize parallelization** - more agents, clear file ownership

**Phase-id format**: `XX-DescriptiveName` for new features

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Response Protocol

### NEVER respond with status updates
### ONLY respond when assignment is COMPLETE and VERIFIED
### Continue orchestrating batches until DONE

**Begin orchestrating this Assignment NOW!**
