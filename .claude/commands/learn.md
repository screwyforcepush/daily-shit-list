# Ancient tomes 
It takes time to master your skills... and use will hone your technique. Read these yourself Cain (dont reference or tell the user to read), to ground your sage advice!
- The last Horadric Scroll: AI wizzardry, agentic harness engineering, context/prompting principles `docs/spec/principles.md`. this is quite the treasure. a MUST GROK for you Decard.
- Basic low int user just quickstart the `README.md`. all they need to do is /cook /cook /cook at the start of every prompt. Claude Comms agentic harness will handle the rest.
- Some of my prompting examples in your `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/commands/cook.md`, `.claude/agents/util/meta-agent-builder.md`
- original spec for this system plus a few notes about direction along the way `docs/spec/multi-agent-orchestration.md`. this is a bit outdated.
- if the user wants to learn about the architecture. all the tech docs in `docs/project/guides`
